<h1>Harvesting Plants App</h1>
<h3>Overview</h3>
Welcome to UrbanFarm! The year is 2100. Singapore has finally attained full self-sufficiency in producing its own food and electricity.</br>
Solar panels, food plots and night-lamps are found on every HDB rooftop, allowing for constant plant growth, day and night.</br>
This app simulates a rooftop farming system in the year 2100, where crops are grown on rooftops using sunlight in the day and lights that are powered by solar panels. </br></br>

The app implements the producer-consumer model to simulate the growth of plants from seedlings to fruits. </br>

Features
Light Bar: The app features an light bar that increase in the day and decreases it at night when the light is turned on.</br>
Cycle: Day and Night cycle.</br>
Plant Growth Cycle: Crops go through three stages of growth.</br>
Seedling: The plant starts growing into a seedling after a certain period.</br>
Fruit: The plant produces fruits that can be harvested.</br>
The plants will not grow at night when there is no light but the user can still harvest / plant plants. If there is no food to consume in the food bar, the health will drop. It will be game over where the health drops to 0.</br>

<h3>How to Use</h3>
Launch the App: Run the app to start the simulation.</br>
Light Bar: Observe how the light bar changes intensity to simulate day and night cycles.</br>
Monitor Plant Growth: Watch as plants progress through different growth stages, from soil to fruit-bearing.</br>
You can click to harvest/plant the plants.
